ruleName: curly
description: Enforces braces for `if`/`for`/`do`/`while` statements.
rationale: |-

  ```ts
  if (foo === bar)
      foo++;
      bar++;
  ```

  In the code above, the author almost certainly meant for both `foo++` and `bar++`
  to be executed only if `foo === bar`. However, he forgot braces and `bar++` will be executed
  no matter what. This rule could prevent such a mistake.
